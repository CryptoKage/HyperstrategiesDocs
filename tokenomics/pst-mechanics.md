6. Token Mechanics (PST)
üßæ Overview
The Performance Streaming Token (PST) represents a performance-aligned token model unique to Hyper‚ÄëStrategies. PST is built on deposit fees, trading performance, and long-term liquidity incentives. The token architecture is designed to reflect real value generated by the protocol.

üîÅ PST Issuance & Utility
Deposit-Linked Allocation
A percentage of users' core vault deposit fees (e.g. 20%) converts into PST credits. These credits act as a buffer for future deposits and may become redeemable or transferable at TGE or redemption events. (See XP)

Performance Streaming
As vaults generate profitable trades, PST is streamed to users as a performance-linked reward, not as one-time points or arbitrary token emissions.

LP Cohort Rewards
Strategic liquidity providers receive PST according to cohort-based schedules‚Äîensuring long-term alignment and reducing farm-to-leave behaviors.

üß© Value Dynamics (Token Model)
Mechanism	PST Source	Purpose / Effect
Initial Deposit Fee	One-time PST credit	Incentivizes early adoption and buffering
Continuous Performance	Streaming PST linked to profits	Rewards actual strategy success
Cohort-Based Liquidity	Rewards over time for LPs	Encourages long-term liquidity provisioning
Buyback Reserve Allocation	From protocol reserves	Supports scarcity and future redemption value

üéØ PST Lifecycle Flow
Initial Deposit ‚Äì PST credit allocated, bonus buffer grows.

Vault Performance ‚Äì As trades execute, backend issues PST incrementally.

Upcoming TGE or Redemption Launch ‚Äì PST becomes redeemable, usable in vaults, or tradeable depending on redemption design.

Ongoing LP Rewards ‚Äì PST unlocks via cohort schedules and staking mechanisms.
