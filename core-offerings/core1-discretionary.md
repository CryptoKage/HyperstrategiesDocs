# Vault Core — Discretionary

The Core vault is our flagship product, operating like a traditional hedge fund with active, discretionary management.

### Strategy

* Trades across spot, perpetual, and stablecoin yield instruments based on market regime and opportunity.
* Focused on trend-following, mean reversion, and macro-driven execution with hedge overlays.
* Manages risk through internal systems—leveraging tools like trailing stop-loss, drawdown controls, and position sizing rules.
* Automatically integrates Hyperliquid rewards (e.g. builder/referral fees and HYPE points) into the Core vault.

### Fee Structure

performance fee structure:

* 20% performance fee
* **20% vault deposit fee (at base level)**

Vault deposit fee: The fee steadily decreases for each additional tier, which depends on the account’s XP. Vault users receive Bonus points for the same value of the vault deposit fee which will be bought back by the project and will also become XP points. The total XP accumulated will determine allocation amount for the TGE. Post TGE bonus points are replaced by the hyperstrategies token. 

* Tier 2 : -2% Discount on deposit fee
* Tier 3 : -4% Discount on deposit fee
* Tier 4: -6% Discount on deposit fee
