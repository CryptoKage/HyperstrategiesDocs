# Core1 — Discretionary Vault

The Core1 vault is our flagship product, operating like a traditional hedge fund with active, discretionary management.

### Strategy
- Trades across spot, perpetual, and stablecoin yield instruments based on market regime and opportunity.
- Focused on trend-following, mean reversion, and macro-driven execution with hidden future hedge overlays.
- Manages risk through internal systems—leveraging tools like trailing stop-loss, drawdown controls, and position sizing rules.
- Provides real-time PnL updates via backend sync, with user-controlled compounding options.
- Automatically integrates Hyperliquid rewards (e.g. builder/referral fees and HYPE points) into each vault.

### Fee Structure
Lock-up tiers dictate the performance fee structure:
- **1-month lock** → 20% performance fee
- **3-month+ lock** → 15% performance fee
