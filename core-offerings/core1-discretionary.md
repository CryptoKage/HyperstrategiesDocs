# Core1 — Discretionary Vault

The Core vault is our flagship product, operating like a traditional hedge fund with active, discretionary management.

### Strategy
- Trades across spot, perpetual, and stablecoin yield instruments based on market regime and opportunity.
- Focused on trend-following, mean reversion, and macro-driven execution with hedge overlays.
- Manages risk through internal systems—leveraging tools like trailing stop-loss, drawdown controls, and position sizing rules.
- Automatically integrates Hyperliquid rewards (e.g. builder/referral fees and HYPE points) into the Core vault.

### Fee Structure
performance fee structure:
- **Vault deposits less than 1-month old** → 20% performance fee
- **Vault deposits more than 3-month old** → 15% performance fee

Initial deposit fee / Onboarding fee:
deposit fee is dependant on the users account level and X score, users are given bonus points in exchange. Bonus points are
bought back by the project and become XP points for the upcoming TGE. Post TGE bonus points are replaced by the hyperstrategies token.

- **First deposit - 20% - Credit 20% bonus points + X = the amount of the deposit**
- **Second deposit - user can deposit up to X before incurring the first deposit fee**

-  Accounts levels 2, 3 , 4 and 5 reduce the fee by 1% per tier and receive larger X multipliers such as 200% and 300% being depositable before deposit fee is required.
