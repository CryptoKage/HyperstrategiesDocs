# Token Mechanics (PST & HYPE)

### Overview
The Performance Streaming Token (PST) aligns Hyper‑Strategies vault participation with broader ecosystem incentives. PST's value is indirectly tied to Hyperliquid’s native HYPE token, whose dynamics drive PST’s worth through rewards, staking, and market valuation.

### HYPE Tokenomics: The Backbone
The HYPE token was launched in November 2024 with a total supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens.

**Key Allocations:**
- **31.00%** - Genesis Airdrop to early users
- **38.89%** - Reserved for future emissions and community rewards
- **23.80%** - Core contributors (vesting through 2027–2028)
- **6.00%** - Hyper Foundation budget
- **0.31%** - Community grants and governance reserves

As of mid-2025, the circulating supply is approximately 33.36% of the total supply.

### Reward Flow & Value Accrual
- **Protocol Distribution:** ~97% of trading fees generated on Hyperliquid are routed into HYPE buybacks or redistributed via community and incentive funds.
- **Buyback Volume:** The protocol has executed hundreds of millions of dollars in cumulative HYPE buybacks since launch, tightening circulating supply and supporting token value using real exchange revenue.

### PST Issuance, Redemption & Utility
- **Bonus Point Mechanics:** Initial Core1 deposit fees are converted into PST-like bonus credits for users.
- **Performance Issuance:** Additional allocations of PST may be granted based on vault profitability or volume tiers.
- **Redeemability & Utility:** PST can potentially be redeemed for HYPE-equivalent value, used to boost reinvestment, or unlock future governance privileges as the platform evolves.

### Alignment: PST ↔ HYPE
| Action | PST or HYPE Outcome | Source of Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Core1 Deposit** | PST bonus credit issued | Derived from the user's deposit fee |
| **Vault Trading** | HYPE points / builder-fee income | Based on traded volume via Hyperliquid |
| **PST Redemption** | e.g., 20 PST ≈ $45 (if HYPE = $45) | Market valuation tied to HYPE |
| **HYPE Staking** | ~2-2.5% APR + fee advantages | Reinforces long-term holding |

### ✅ Summary
- PST ties Hyper‑Strategies vault usage to Hyperliquid’s economic engine, anchoring its value to a market-influenced native token (HYPE).
- HYPE’s deflationary mechanics (buybacks), yield incentives (staking), and governance pathways ensure that PST utility scales with ecosystem growth.
- As HYPE's value accrues, so does PST's potential—creating a fully aligned vault-incentive model.
