# Withdrawal & Reinvestment Logic (Core1)

This system is designed to reward user loyalty and encourage reinvestment of capital.

### How It Works (Quick Overview)
- **Initial Deposit Fee:** A deposit triggers a fee (tier-dependent discounts available).
- **Active Allocation:** When using the Core Vault, 80% of the deposit is deployed into trading. For the Ape Vault, 90% are traded instead; the remaining portion is issued as bonus points.
- **Bonus Buffer Mechanic:** An "effectively fee-free buffer" between 0% and 100% of the deposit value allows reinvested capital without further initial feesâ€”up to the buffer size.
- **Tiered Fee Discounts:** Users in higher tiers pay lower initial deposit fees (down to 14% at tier 4), reducing the bonus-point allocation accordingly.

### Initial Deposit Example:
- A User (Tier 1) deposits **$1,000**.
- A 20% fee (**$200**) is credited to the user as bonus points.
- **$800** is deployed into the trading vault.
- The user's "Bonus Buffer" is now set to **$1,000**.
