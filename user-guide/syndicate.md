How Ref Syndicates Work

Join a Syndicate

Sign up for our fund using a unique referral link shared by a Ref Syndicate. This links you to a community pool where all members benefit together.

Each account is tied to a unique blockchain wallet address, ensuring fairness and transparency.

Earn Syndicate Rewards

Our fund charges a 17-20% performance fee on profits. A portion of this fee (1-3%) is allocated to your syndicateâ€™s reward pool, based on the total deposits in your syndicate:

1% for syndicates with less than $1M in total deposits.

2% for syndicates with $1M to $5M in total deposits.

3% for syndicates with over $5M in total deposits.

Rewards are distributed equally among all syndicate members with deposits of $1,000 or more, ensuring everyone shares in the success.
