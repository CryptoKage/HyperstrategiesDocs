Hyper‑Strategies is a DeFi-native hedge fund focused on delivering institutional-grade trading strategies in an accessible, on-chain-first format. We make sophisticated trading available to retail users—even without deep crypto literacy—while still serving experienced DeFi-native participants.

Capital is deployed across modular, efficient venues like Hyperliquid, allowing us to not only execute trades but also earn protocol-based upside through volume-based rewards. These rewards can be reinvested into strategies or shared back with users.

Our flagship Core1 vault uses discretionary trading logic across multiple crypto assets, including market regimes and yield-stacking during low periods. For users who prefer automated exposure, Vault2 (the APE/USDC dual-media average strategy) provides rules-based passive trading. Vault3 will be released in future with additional strategy types.
