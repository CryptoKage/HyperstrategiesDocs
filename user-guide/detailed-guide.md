### 4. Understanding Vault Logic & Buffer System

After depositing, Core1 vault operates as follows:

- A portion of the deposit fee is credited as a **bonus buffer**.
- *Next deposit* up to the buffer amount is **fee-free** and fully invested.
- Deposits beyond the buffer trigger a new fee on the excess amount only.
- Users can toggle **Auto‑Compound**:
  - **ON**: Profits stay in Core1 automatically.
  - **OFF**: Profits are withdrawn back to your Hyper‑Strategies wallet.
- Performance fees apply only to trading profit (not buffer or deposit) depending on lock-up term.

### 5. Using Vault2 (Dual EMA ApeCoin Strategy)

- Vault2 requires no configuration—just deposit USDC.
- Strategy trades automatically on APE/USDC via Dual EMA logic.
- Risk settings are managed on-chain; profits compound by default.
