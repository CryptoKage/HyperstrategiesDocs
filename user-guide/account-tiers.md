# Understanding Account Tiers

Your **Account Tier** is a measure of your overall contribution and commitment to the HyperStrategies ecosystem. By actively participating on the platform, you earn Experience Points (XP), which in turn increases your Account Tier. Higher tiers unlock significant benefits, rewarding our most loyal users.

Our tier system is currently capped at **Tier 4** as we gather data to refine and expand the system in the future.

### How Tiers Work

Your tier is automatically calculated based on your total XP. Here are the current thresholds and the key benefits you'll receive at each level:

| Tier    | XP Required       | Key Benefits                                                |
| :------ | :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tier 1**  | 0 - 749 XP        | Standard platform access.                                   |
| **Tier 2**  | 750 - 1,499 XP    | **-2%** Deposit Fee Discount on the Core Vault.             |
| **Tier 3**  | 1,500 - 2,999 XP  | **-4%** Deposit Fee Discount on the Core Vault.             |
| **Tier 4**  | 3,000+ XP       | **-6%** Deposit Fee (Core) & **-10%** Performance Fee (ApeCoin). |

### How to Earn XP

Leveling up your Account Tier is all about earning XP. Here are the primary ways to do so:

*   **Capital Allocation:** Earn **1 XP** for every $10 of capital you allocate to any vault.
*   **Time-Staked Bonus:** Earn daily XP for the capital you keep active in vaults. This rewards long-term commitment.
*   **Successful Referrals:** Earn a significant XP bonus when a new user you referred makes their first capital allocation.
*   **Bonus Point Buy-Back:** Earn **0.1 XP** for every 1 Bonus Point the platform buys back from you.
