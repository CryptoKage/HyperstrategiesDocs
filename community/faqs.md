# Frequently Asked Questions

General Questions
Q: What vault options does Hyper‑Strategies offer?

Two live vaults:

Core1: Multi-asset, discretionary strategy with adaptive regime-based trading.

Vault2: Rules-based, dual-EMA trend-following on APE/USDC.

Future release: Vault3, featuring upgraded automated logic and diversified assets.

Q: Do I need DeFi or crypto experience to use vaults?

No technical knowledge is required. Core1 manages strategy automatically. Vault2 requires only a deposit to begin.

On Fees, Buffer & Loyalty
Q: How do deposit and performance fees work?

Deposit fee: Typically 20% of initial Core1 deposit (reduced in higher account tiers). Converts into PST-like bonus points.

Performance fee: 20% on profit for 1-month lock‑ups, or 15% for 3 months or more. Applies only to profit—not deposit buffer.

Q: What is the bonus buffer?

It's equal to your initial deposit: you receive bonus points, and your next deposit up to that buffer is fee-free and fully deployed. Exceeding it triggers fees on the excess portion.

Strategy Tools & Risk Controls
Q: Are trailing stop-loss tools available?

Yes. Our internal bots implement configurable stop-loss logic (including trailing stop-loss and OCO configurations) automatically through Hyperliquid APIs—no manual action needed.

Q: Can I use your strategy tools directly?

We plan to release strategy tool templates integrated via Hyperliquid builder codes. You’ll be able to run the same automation tools we use—builder fee revenue accrues to us based on execution. Optional tool licensing may apply.

Integration & Wallets
Q: How do I connect to Hyperliquid?

Use MetaMask configured for HyperEVM (Chain ID: 999, RPC: https://rpc.hyperliquid.xyz/evm). Once connected, you can approve builder-fee functionality, deposit assets, and manage vault strategies.

Q: What is a builder code?

A feature of Hyperliquid that embeds a micro-fee (~0.01–0.1%) into each trade executed via your strategy. Builder fees accrue to Hyper‑Strategies, not deducted from capital or profit.

PST & HYPE Tokens
Q: What is PST and why does it matter?

PST represents bonus point value from deposit and performance. It’s tied indirectly to HYPE, the native token of Hyperliquid, and reflects both accrued rewards and market price exposure.

Q: How is PST connected to HYPE?

HYPE buybacks consume up to 97% of trading fees, enhancing token scarcity. As HYPE price rises, future PST redemption value may increase. HYPE staking also yields ~2–2.5% APR and unlocks higher referral tiers.

Security & Compliance
Q: Is Hyperliquid secure?

Hyperliquid is a decentralized protocol with audited smart contracts and non‑custodial custody. That said, any on-chain protocol carries inherent risk from bugs or oracle attacks—always use caution.

Q: Do I need to verify my identity?

No. Hyperliquid enables non-custodial trading without mandatory KYC across most jurisdictions.

Getting Started
Q: How do I begin using Core1?

Connect MetaMask to HyperEVM and deposit USDC.

Decide on a lock-up duration and deposit to Core1.

Monitor your bonus buffer, tier level, and strategy performance.

Toggle auto-compound or withdraw profits as you wish.

Q: Why do I pay deposit & performance fees?

Deposit fees fund system infrastructure and create bonus incentives. Performance fees align our team’s outcomes with your growth—only charged on profit.
