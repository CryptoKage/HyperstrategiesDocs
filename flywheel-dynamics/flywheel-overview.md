# The Hyper-Strategies Value Flywheel

### 🔁 Overview
Hyper‑Strategies is fueled by a performance flywheel: user capital drives vault trading volume, which generates protocol incentives, leading to yield or token upside, which in turn reinforces user growth and further deposits.

### Flywheel Components & Metrics

#### Volume → Protocol Rewards
As users place trades via our vaults, a significant portion of the collected trading fees on Hyperliquid are recycled into HYPE buybacks or redistributed via the protocol's Assistance Fund. This creates sustained buy-side pressure for the HYPE token.

#### Reward Distribution
Builders (like Hyper-Strategies) earn referral fees on volume, and vault users receive points that can be converted into our native PST token or redistributed as liquidity. This adds a compounding layer to vault returns.

#### Tiered Fee Structure
- **Builder fees (~0.01% per trade)** flow directly to Hyper‑Strategies as revenue.
- **Performance fees (20% for 1-month lock / 15% for 3+ months)** encourage longer-term capital commitment from users.
